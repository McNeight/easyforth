* Tokenizer
  - needs to be smart about strings
  - strings only output in definitions
* Compiler/Interpreter
  - should create these
* readLine improvements
  - invalidWord should throw an exception
  - output ends after missing word
  - output will be added to end of line in interactive editor
* Implement dict
  - implement forget?
* Allow definitions
* Implement useful subset of preset definitions
* Interactive editor
  - highlight output differently maybe?
  - will have to be sensitive to colon definitions, and wait for semicolon before interpreting
