* line.split improvements
  - needs to handle multiple spaces
  - needs to be smart about strings
* Implement dict
  - if in dict, call execute on definition, or just execute definition?
  - if not in dict, call number, which pushes the number onto the stack, if it's a number, otherwise outputs `?`
  - case insensitive
  - implement forget?
* Allow definitions
* Implement useful subset of preset definitions
* Interactive editor
  - highlight output differently maybe?
